This site uses Gatsby.js.

This particular page is created with a markdown file.

###Some Cool Things About Gatsby:

- Uses GraphQL
- Check out `/my-files` to see a graphQL generated list of files
- This is possible via a gatsby source plugin called "gatsby-source-filesystem" that can live reload data
- Generates a single static file, similar to webpack, that you can post to a simple static site host, including github pages.
- Gatsby lets you use GraphQL to query your data and map the data to pagesâ€”all at build time.

###Some more specifics

- Source plugins bring data into Gatsby's data system
- Transformer plugins transform raw content brought by source plugins

###Markdown Stuff

- To create pages from markdown files, we use two Gatsby API's
  -onCreateNode
  -createPages
